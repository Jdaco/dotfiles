* My Workstation Configurations

This repository contains configurations for all of my workstations. I'm using Org-mode and a Literate Programming approach to storing my configurations

- The =machines.org= file represents the configuration needs of each of my machines
- Configuration files are separated into =.org= files in this for different categories
- These categories can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Include-Files.html][included]] (or not) into the machine subheadings in =machines.org=
- I use ~org-babel-tangle~ to then export these files into the correct place on your filesystem
  + Any [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Macro-Replacement.html][org-export macros]] are replaced in the files before tangling
** Goals
- Be able to automatically set up new workstations
- Produce a live image that I can run from a USB drive
