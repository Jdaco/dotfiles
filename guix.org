** Channels
I add the [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][nonguix]] channel so that I have access to firefox and wifi drivers when I need them

My dotfiles repository is also it's own Guix channel, wich the package definitions living in =ccc.scm=

#+begin_src scheme :tangle ~/.config/guix/channels.scm
(cons* (channel
        (name 'nonguix)
        (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix")
        ;; Enable signature verification:
        (introduction
         (make-channel-introduction
          "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc"

       (channel
                (name 'ccc)
                (url (string-append "file://" (getenv "HOME") "/dotfiles")))

** Shells

I need my =.profile= to include the path to my guix profile so that Eshell over TRAMP will pick up my guix binaries. The =.profile= is source when you include ='tramp-own-remote-path= in =tramp-remote-path=

#+begin_src sh :tangle "~/.profile"
#!/usr/bin/env sh

export PATH=${HOME}/.guix-profile/bin:$PATH
#+end_src
