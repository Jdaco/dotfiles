#+title: Jira

I use [[id:5a11c97f-121f-4724-b5df-e3030347ec4e][org-jira]] to interact with Jira. This makes it easier to search and update tasks. However, I don't put all of my thoughts and notes into Jira, so I usually have a task in my main org file that's linked to the Jira task

* org-jira

To get [[https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira][org-jira]] working for your Jira setup you'll need to set these settings

#+begin_src elisp
(setq jiralib-url "https://example.atlassian.net"
      ccc/jira-boards  '("EXMPL")
      ccc/jira-user-name "The Emperor"
      ccc/jira-files ("~/.org-jira/PROJ.org")
      )
#+end_src

You'll also need to add your API key to =~/.authinfo=

#+begin_src conf
machine example.atlassian.net login user@email.com password long-api-key port 443
#+end_src

** Config
#+begin_src elisp :noweb-ref configs
(setq org-jira-use-status-as-todo t
      org-jira-boards-default-limit 1000
      ;; This is to ensure curl can load your certs from Guix
      request-curl-options (list (format "--cacert %s" (f-expand  "~/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt")))
      )

(map!
   (:leader
    :prefix "o I"
    "c" #'org-jira-create-issue
    "u" #'org-jira-update-issue
    ))

#+end_src

** Packages
#+begin_src elisp :noweb-ref packages
(package! request)
(package! org-jira :recipe '(:type git :host github :repo "Ruin0x11/org-jira") :pin "3670719cf05495e99003ebb9e77ec96dfd5e9b9a")
